<a name="home-control-panel" class="anchor" href="#home-control-panel"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Home Control Panel</h1>

<p>Home Control Panel has been in development for a couple of months now, where the first try to set up this project was too complex and user-unfriendly. Because the scope of the project changed a bit (explanation below) and because I was ready for a <em>swift</em>-only project, I decided that most of the stuff could use a rewrite.</p>

<h1>
<a name="goals" class="anchor" href="#goals"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goals</h1>

<p>The goals of <strong>HCP</strong> are to be able to control my home from an iPad which I have laying around. For this, you of course need hardware to perform most of (well, actually: all) functions this application offers.</p>

<p>I want to be able to connect to several devices and all control them from one giant control-panel. With this functionality I want to stay as close to the feature-set as the supported hardware supports.</p>

<p>At first the idea was that only <a href="http://homewizard.nl">HomeWizard</a> devices could be controlled by this application, but as soon as I added beta testers to the first alpha release of the application, requests for more supported devices came rolling in. So HCP is now less <a href="http://homewizard.nl">HomeWizard</a> focussed and also functions when you do not have one.</p>

<h1>
<a name="ios-compatibility" class="anchor" href="#ios-compatibility"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>iOS Compatibility</h1>

<p>iOS7 and up probably, but when HomeKit is fully revealed by Apple it might be iOS8 and higher.</p>

<h1>
<a name="supported-hardware" class="anchor" href="#supported-hardware"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Supported Hardware</h1>

<p>Currently the project focusses on 2 hardware devices, but can later be expanded by either me or other fellow developers.</p>

<h3>
<a name="homewizard" class="anchor" href="#homewizard"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>HomeWizard</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://homewizard.nl">HomeWizard</a> is a device that let's you tie all kinds of devices together. A couple of supported devices are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Smart P1 based power meters</li>
<li>Klik-aan/Klik-uit switches (quite popular in the Netherlands)</li>
<li>RF based door sensors</li>
<li>RF based thermometers</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="philips-hue" class="anchor" href="#philips-hue"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Philips Hue</h3>

<p>Does the <a href="http://www2.meethue.com/en-US">Philips Hue Bridge</a> need an introduction? RGB LED powered lights which can be controlled using your phone or tablet.</p>

<h1>
<a name="model-definitions" class="anchor" href="#model-definitions"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Model definitions</h1>

<p>In the model these are defined as <code>Controller</code> objects. A <code>Controller</code> is a device that can control one or more connected devices (like lights, cameras etc.).</p>

<p>Because every controller has different discovery methods and ways to communicate with its devices, the <code>HueBridge</code> and <code>HomeWizard</code> classes are subclassed from the abstract <code>Controller</code> class.</p>

<h1>
<a name="api-documentation" class="anchor" href="#api-documentation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>API documentation</h1>

<p>I try to document all the API calls I perform, because not everything is documented as good as I'd like. Visit the <a href="https://github.com/depl0y/HCP/wiki">Github Wiki</a> I created for this.</p>

<h1>
<a name="localisation" class="anchor" href="#localisation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Localisation</h1>

<p>The application will be prepared to be fully multi-lingual, but our main focus is English and Dutch.</p>

<h1>
<a name="used-frameworks-and-tools" class="anchor" href="#used-frameworks-and-tools"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Used Frameworks and tools</h1>

<p>For this application I currently use the following frameworks:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://afnetworking.com">AFNetworking</a> - An awesome networking library that I use for all HTTP requests.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/magicalpanda/MagicalRecord">MagicalRecord</a> - CoreData in an ActiveRecord kind of way</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/rentzsch/mogenerator">Mogenerator</a> - Generate Swift files for my CoreData models</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/CocoaLumberjack/CocoaLumberjack">CocoaLumberjack</a> - Better logging than <code>NSLog</code>.</li>
</ul><h1>
<a name="license" class="anchor" href="#license"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>License</h1>

<p>I chose the current license because I want to be able to share my progress and code with the world, but I also have the intention of putting this application up in the Apple App Store and maybe fund some more hardware for my HCP setup.</p>

Because the scope of the project changed a bit (explanation below) and because I was ready for a *swift*-only project, I decided that most of the stuff could use a rewrite.\r\n\r\n#Goals\r\nThe goals of **HCP** is to be able to control my home from an iPad which I have laying around. For this, you of course need hardware to perform most of (well, actually: all) functions this application offers.\r\n\r\nI want to be able to connect to several devices and all control them from one giant control-panel. With this functionality I want to stay as close to the feature-set as the supported hardware supports.\r\n\r\nAt first the idea was that only [HomeWizard](http://homewizard.nl) devices could be controlled by this application, but as soon as I added beta testers to the first alpha release of the application, requests for more supported devices came rolling in. So HCP is now less [HomeWizard](http://homewizard.nl) focussed and also functions when you do not have one.\r\n\r\n#iOS Compatibility\r\n\r\n**iOS8**, better make sure you got your devices updated and ready.\r\n\r\n#Supported Hardware\r\n\r\nCurrently the project focusses on 2 hardware devices, but can later be expanded by either me or other fellow developers.\r\n\r\n###HomeWizard\r\nThe [HomeWizard](http://homewizard.nl) is a device that let's you tie all kinds of devices together. A couple of supported devices are:\r\n* Smart P1 based power meters\r\n* Klik-aan/Klik-uit switches (quite popular in the Netherlands)\r\n* RF based door sensors\r\n* RF based thermometers\r\n* IP cameras\r\n\r\n###Philips Hue\r\nDoes the [Philips Hue Bridge](http://www2.meethue.com/en-US) need an introduction? RGB LED powered lights which can be controlled using your phone or tablet.\r\n\r\n#Model definitions\r\nIn the model these are defined as `Controller` objects. A `Controller` is a device that can control one or more connected devices (like lights, cameras etc.).\r\n\r\nBecause every controller has different discovery methods and ways to communicate with its devices, the `HueBridge` and `HomeWizard` classes are subclassed from the abstract `Controller` class.\r\n\r\nThe `Controller` class defines a couple of methods that each subclass of the `Controller` class should override.\r\n\r\n**Override these methods**\r\n\r\n`class func discover(completion: (results: [Controller]) -> Void)`\r\n\r\nThe **discover** method should try to find local controllers of this type. Both the Hue Bridge and the HomeWizard devices support discovery of local devices. These devices should be returned in an array, while **not yet** stored in the CoreData database.\r\n\r\n\r\n`func start()`\r\n\r\nFor both the HomeWizard and the Hue Bridge, this starts a timer which fetches data and new sensors on a regular interval.\r\n\r\n\r\n`func stop()`\r\n\r\nThis should stop the timers that are running on the `Controller` object.\r\n\r\n\r\n#Sensor definitions\r\nEvery supported device-type has its own model defined. For example a simple `Switch` connected to the HomeWizard has a model names `Switch`. Each model has the responsibility to create a request which can be send to the `Controller` to perform the selected action.\r\n\r\nA switch has 2 methods, `on` and `off` and this is an example of the `on` function.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunc on() -> Void {\r\n\r\n        // Just cast to HomeWizard, this will never make it in production code.... right?        \r\n        (self.controller! as HomeWizard).performAction(String(format: \"/sw/%d/on\", self.id!), completion: { (results) -> Void in\r\n        });\r\n        \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#API documentation\r\n\r\nI try to document all the API calls I perform, because not everything is documented as good as I'd like. Visit the [Github Wiki](https://github.com/depl0y/HCP/wiki) I created for this.\r\n\r\n#Localisation\r\nThe application will be prepared to be fully multi-lingual, but **our** main focus is English and Dutch. We of course will accept pull requests with translations.\r\n\r\n#Also on my mind\r\nThere are a couple of things that are on my mind, that I would love to integrate in HCP.\r\n\r\n* Time based triggers.\r\n* Sensor based trigger.\r\n* XBMC controller, to control XBMC devices located in your house.\r\n* OSX version, control your house from your OSX status bar.\r\n\r\n*These things will be build after the first release to the App Store.*\r\n\r\n#Used Frameworks and tools\r\n\r\nFor this application I currently use the following frameworks (in no particular order).\r\n\r\n* [AFNetworking](http://afnetworking.com) - An awesome networking library that I use for all HTTP requests.\r\n* [Classy](http://classy.as) - Styling of UIKit using CSS-like files.\r\n* [DZNSegmentedControl](https://github.com/dzenbot/DZNSegmentedControl) - A great control, used to page through the screens.\r\n* [MagicalRecord/Shorthand](https://github.com/magicalpanda/MagicalRecord) - CoreData in an ActiveRecord kind of way.\r\n* [Mogenerator](https://github.com/rentzsch/mogenerator) - Generate Swift files for my CoreData models.\r\n* [Telerik UI for iOS](http://www.telerik.com/ios-ui) (Commercial) - Great graph rendering and feedback system.\r\n* [UICKeyChainStore](https://github.com/kishikawakatsumi/UICKeyChainStore) - Easy KeyChain access.\r\n* [XCGLogger](https://github.com/DaveWoodCom/XCGLogger) - XCGLogger is a log framework written in Swift.\r\n\r\n#Thanks\r\nThanks to the following people, making this project possible:\r\n\r\n* [Telerik](http://www.telerik.com/) for supplying me a [Telerik UI for iOS](http://www.telerik.com/ios-ui) license for free to incorporate in this project.\r\n* My wife, for her eternal patience ;)\r\n* My enthousiastic Alpha testers.\r\n\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n[![BY-NC Logo](https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc/4.0/80x15.png)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)\r\n\r\nThis work is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/).","google":"UA-54520744-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
